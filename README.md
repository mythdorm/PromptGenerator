# PromptGenerator

This program's main purpose is to generate a prompt based on whatever has been added to the "prompt pool".
The prompt pool can be updated at almost any time and will be saved in a trio of .txt files in the program's main directory.

During any line, "exit" can be entered and the program will end.
Similarly, "back" can be entered to return to an earlier choice.

When the program first runs, it will create 3 files ("AdjectiveList.txt", "NounList.txt" and "VerbList.txt") that will store the "pools" of each part that will be stored for later use.
When adding to these pools, it is recommended a space and/or a comma be used along side the word(s).
Even when entering a single word, it is important to include one of the above.

During the first line, "view" can be used to view any or all of the pools.
"noun" can be entered to view nouns, "adjectives" for adjectives, and "verbs" will result in verbs being output. Furthermore, "all" will show all three pools together.

You do not need to open the .txt files to add more words to the pools. Simply type "yes" or "y" on the first line and select which pool you want to edit.
After a selection has been made, any number of words can be added. 
Also, entering "sample" will result in a small selection of words being added to each of the prompt pools.
